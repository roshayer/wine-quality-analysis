# Wine-Data-Analysis

Dataset: winequality-red.csv

Predictive approach was used on the Red Wine Quality Dataset to determine which features are the best quality red wine indicators and generate insights into each of these factors to our modelâ€™s red wine quality. Neural Network using Tensorflow & Keras was implemented to classify wine quality. Evaluation metrics like R-squared, RSME, MAE were used to determine the performance of the regression models.
